1. Overview of VARS-TOOL
========================

VARS-TOOL is a next-generation, multi-method sensitivity and uncertainty analysis software toolbox,
applicable to the full range of computer simulation models, including Dynamical Earth Systems
Models (DESMs). Developed primarily around the powerful “Variogram Analysis of Response
Surfaces” (VARS) framework, VARS-TOOL provides a comprehensive suite of algorithms and
methods for global sensitivity analysis (GSA), including ones based on the derivative-based (such as
the method of Morris), distribution-based (particularly the variance-based method of Sobol’), and
variogram-based (such as VARS) approaches.

The underlying approach of the VARS-TOOL toolkit is described in detail in the following publications:
